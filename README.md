# my_projects
This is a repository containing four different projects that I have worked on. The projects are:

Django CRUD App - A simple web application built using the Django framework that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data from a database.

Django Weather App - A web application built using Django and the OpenWeatherMap API that allows users to get current weather information for a given city.

JS CRUD App - A simple web application built using vanilla JavaScript that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data from a local storage.

Django Chat App - A web application built using Django and AJAX that allows users to chat in real-time.


How to run the projects
o run these django projects, you need to have Python and Django installed on your machine. 
Once you have installed the necessary requirements, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:

""""""""""""""""""""""
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
